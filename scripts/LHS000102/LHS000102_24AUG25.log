WARNING: The covariates are not specified in an FCS discriminant method for variable birth_order_spacing_c5, only remaining 
         continuous variables will be used as covariates with the default CLASSEFFECTS=EXCLUDE option.
WARNING: An effect for variable birth_weight is a linear combination of other effects. The coefficient of the effect will be set to 
         zero in the imputation.
